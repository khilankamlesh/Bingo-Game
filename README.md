2. set the numbers contained on every bingo card in the game;
3. process sequences of numbers to be ‘called’; 20
4. mark matched numbers on all bingo cards currently in use;
5. test whether a bingo card is a fullhouse winner

## File Layout ##
* Extract JavaAssign2_Khilan_Kamlesh_2307483 and open folder as project in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
* UML.png shows a UML generated diagram to visualise class and method relationships generated in IntelliJ using plugins 'Call Graph', 'SequenceDiagram' and 'UMLGenerator'
* Code design and implementation in Assignment212/src folder
* Assignment212/testFiles folder includes .txt files to test the functionality and edge case scenarios in IntelliJ after completing a section of code.
* The results of tests are compared against expectedOutput files in the Assignment212/answerFiles folder using IntelliJ's Run/Debug configurations.
* Output of code is copied to file StudentOutput.txt
